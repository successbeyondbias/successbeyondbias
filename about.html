                    <p>
                        Hi there! I decided to create this "About Me" page so that you all could get to know me better! My name is Angelica, and I've created this website to showcase the incredible talents of individuals from underrepresented communities in STEM. The main purpose of this website is to provide a safe space and foster a supportive community.

The moment I learned basic HTML, I knew I wanted to bring this website to life. Growing up, I remember searching for "Computer Programmers" and being greeted with images of people who didn't resemble me. In my mind, I believed I had to look like them to become a Programmer myself; however, I soon realized I was mistaken. Underrepresented communities are growing, and I want to ensure that I can highlight the achievements of talented individuals from these communities throughout history and from various places!

Everyone deserves to be celebrated, and it's crucial for people to have role models they can look up to, who share their backgrounds and experiences. That's what I hope to achieve with this website. So, let's celebrate talent and diversity together! ðŸ˜Š
